# Pipelined RISC-V Processor
A RISC-V pipeline processor design leverages the simplicity and modularity of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to implement an efficient, high-performance processing unit. The processor is built around a 5-stage pipeline architecture, allowing instruction-level parallelism where multiple instructions are processed simultaneously, each at different stages.

Key Components of the Pipeline Processor:

#Pipeline Stages:

1. Instruction Fetch (IF): The instruction is fetched from memory using the Program Counter (PC). The PC is updated for the next instruction.
2. Instruction Decode (ID): The fetched instruction is decoded to determine the operation type, and the operands are read from the register file.
3. Execute (EX): The arithmetic or logical operations are performed using the ALU, and branch decisions are made.
4. Memory Access (MEM): For load/store instructions, data is read from or written to the memory.
5. Write Back (WB): The result is written back to the register file, completing the instruction's execution.
