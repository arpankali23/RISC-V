# Pipelined RISC-V Processor
A RISC-V pipeline processor design leverages the simplicity and modularity of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to implement an efficient, high-performance processing unit. The processor is built around a 5-stage pipeline architecture, allowing instruction-level parallelism where multiple instructions are processed simultaneously, each at different stages.
